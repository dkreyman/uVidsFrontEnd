## About

For this project, I used React.js because I'm most familiar with it and for its helpful useState hook which I used to manage the state in the UI. I also used react slick to assist me with the video carousel because it was easy to use and implement. In terms of structure, I divided the UI into 3 main components one to display the video and description, one to display all video thumbnails, and another all favorited video thumbnails also in a carousel.
